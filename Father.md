## How to Start Every Session (minimise tokens)

```
Read Father.md.
Task: [one sentence — what to fix or build]
File: [path/to/exact/file.tsx if known]
Do not touch anything outside that file.
```

**Rules to keep sessions cheap:**
- One task per message. Never bundle multiple bugs or features.
- Always give the file path if you know it. Exploration is expensive.
- Bugs: describe what's wrong and where. Not just "it's broken".
- Features: describe what it should do, not just what it looks like.
- After session ends, update "Known Issues / Next Tasks" below so next session starts with zero exploration.

## Tech Stack — Critical Facts

| Layer | Technology | Gotcha |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 16.2.4 (App Router) | `middleware.ts` → renamed to `proxy.ts`, exports `proxy()` not `middleware()` |
| Language | TypeScript strict | |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 | NO `tailwind.config.ts` — tokens in `app/globals.css` `@theme inline {}` |
| UI | shadcn/ui v4 + **@base-ui/react** | NOT Radix. `Button` has NO `asChild` prop. Select shows UUID if you rely on SelectValue auto-detection — render the label explicitly in the trigger instead |
| Icons | Lucide React | |
| Database | Supabase PostgreSQL + RLS | Always filter by `business_id` even though RLS is on |
| Auth | Supabase Auth | |
| Forms | react-hook-form + Zod v4 | `z.coerce.number()` causes resolver type errors with hookform v7 — use `z.number()` and convert in `onChange` |
| State | Zustand | Global UI state only |
| Email | Gmail API + Resend fallback | Gmail OAuth credentials can be stored in Settings → Integrations or env; templates in `lib/resend.ts`, provider routing in `lib/email.ts` |
| SMS | Quo API | `lib/quo.ts` |
| Payments | Stripe | `lib/stripe.ts` |
| Deploy | Vercel | Auto-deploys from `main` branch |

**Brand blue:** `oklch(0.545 0.137 232)` = `#007bb8`
**Never commit `.env.local`.** Never hardcode secrets.

## Key Architectural Decisions

**Select trigger display** — `@base-ui/react` Select.Value does not reliably render item labels when value is a UUID. Always render the selected label explicitly inside `SelectTrigger`:
```tsx
<SelectTrigger>
  {selectedItem ? <span>{selectedItem.label}</span> : <SelectValue placeholder="..." />}
</SelectTrigger>
```

**Team member assignment on quotes** — Quotes table has no `assigned_to` column. Team assignment is encoded into `internal_notes` with prefix `__team__:{json}`. Use `encodeTeamInNotes` / `decodeTeamFromNotes` from `lib/supabase/queries/quotes.ts`. The detail page parses and displays the assigned member separately; the Notes tab shows only `actualNotes`.

**Booking-style job creation** — `/jobs/new` uses `components/jobs/JobForm.tsx` in `booking` mode. It can create a new client/address or use an existing client/address, then creates the `jobs` row, first `job_line_items` row, optional `job_visits` row, and optional `visit_assignments` row in one submit through `createJob()` in `lib/supabase/queries/jobs.ts`. Job detail edit uses the same component in `compact` mode to avoid re-rendering the full booking flow.

**Server actions pattern** — Server actions live inside the page file (not in query files). Query files export pure DB functions. Pages wire actions → queries → revalidatePath/redirect.

**Admin client** — Use `createAdminClient()` from `lib/supabase/admin.ts` for operations that bypass RLS (e.g., booking widget submissions, team invites).

**Job confirmations + reminders** â€” Job detail now has `Send to Client` and `Send to Cleaner` actions. These currently create internal notification structure and queue reminder rows through `sendJobConfirmation()` in `lib/supabase/queries/jobs.ts`; SMS delivery uses Quo API via `lib/quo.ts`. Reminder behavior is controlled from Settings â†’ Alerts using `job_reminders_enabled`, `job_reminder_24h`, and `job_reminder_1h` on `businesses`. Job send status is tracked on `jobs.client_confirmation_sent_at` and `jobs.cleaner_confirmation_sent_at`.

---

## DB Tables (all 28, all have RLS)

`businesses`, `users`, `clients`, `client_addresses`, `client_contacts`, `services`, `quotes`, `quote_line_items`, `jobs`, `job_line_items`, `job_visits`, `visit_assignments`, `labor_entries`, `expenses`, `invoices`, `invoice_line_items`, `payments`, `requests`, `tax_rates`, `forms`, `form_submissions`, `notifications`, `reminders`, `notes`, `chemical_treatments`, `tags`, `taggables`, `audit_logs`

**Quotes table columns** (no `assigned_to` — stored in `internal_notes`):
`id, business_id, client_id, address_id, quote_number, title, status, frequency, subtotal, total, discount_amount, tax_amount, valid_until, message_to_client, internal_notes, sent_at, approved_at, created_by, service_id, created_at, updated_at`

## Known Issues / Next Tasks

> Update this section at the end of every session. This is what the next session reads first.

**Fixed this session (2026-05-02):**
- Settings: added **Integrations** tab with setup/status cards for Gmail, Stripe, Quo, Google Calendar, and Resend fallback (`app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx`, `components/settings/IntegrationsTab.tsx`)
- SMS: replaced Twilio integration with Quo API credentials (`QUO_API_KEY`, `QUO_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`, optional `QUO_USER_ID`) and wired appointment reminder SMS through `lib/quo.ts`.
- Email sending: added Gmail API sender that uses Google OAuth env vars when fully configured, with Resend preserved as fallback (`lib/gmail.ts`, `lib/email.ts`, invoice/quote send routes). Required Gmail env names: `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` or `GMAIL_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` or `GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN` or `GMAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN`, and `GMAIL_FROM_EMAIL`
- Clients: client table three-dot menu has **Edit** and **Email** actions; Email opens a send dialog with subject/message/attachments and posts to `/api/clients/send-email`, which uses Gmail first and Resend fallback through `sendTransactionalEmail()`.
- Gmail verification: `.env.local` includes Google OAuth/Gmail sender keys and Google token refresh returned `GMAIL_OAUTH_OK` on 2026-05-02.
- Settings → Alerts tab: added **Email** section at top with reply-to address input (saves to `businesses.email`) and **Alerts** sub-header above notification toggles (`components/settings/NotificationsTab.tsx`)
- `settings/page.tsx`: `NotificationValues` now includes `email`; `updateNotifications` server action explicitly saves it to `businesses` table alongside the toggle fields
- `app/api/invoices/send/route.ts` + `app/api/quotes/send/route.ts`: both now fetch `email` alongside `name` from the business record and pass it as `reply_to` on every Resend `emails.send()` call — client replies land in the business's inbox instead of noreply

**Fixed this session (2026-05-01):**
- Schedule: added prev/next month buttons (`ChevronsLeft/Right`) + date jump input to `WeekCalendar.tsx`
- Requests: added "New Request" button on `requests/page.tsx` → `/requests/new`
- Quotes: fixed client UUID showing in select trigger — now renders name explicitly
- Quotes: added team member assignment UI + wage input to `QuoteForm.tsx`; encode/decode via `encodeTeamInNotes`/`decodeTeamFromNotes` in `quotes.ts`; detail page shows assigned member in Quote Info card
- Sidebar: Create button is now a dropdown for Client, Request, Quote, Job, Invoice; removed hard-coded Requests/Jobs badges
- Search: global search now includes direct client/request name/email/phone/address, direct job/quote/invoice numbers/titles, and address-linked clients/jobs/quotes/invoices/requests
- Dashboard home: Appointments panel now uses real `job_visits`, links to jobs, shows customer/assigned tech/location/price, and supports date + team member filters
- Requests: `/requests/new` creates manual authenticated requests with `source = manual` and redirects to the created request detail page
- Jobs: `/jobs/new` was redesigned into a BookingKoala-style booking form wired to real clients, addresses, services, line items, first visit scheduling, team assignment, and job totals; orange tab accent removed in favor of brand blue
- Quotes: `/quotes/new` now supports initial pricing on creation through first line item fields in `QuoteForm.tsx`; `createQuote()` inserts the first `quote_line_items` row and recalculates totals in the same submit
- Invoices: fixed client/job UUIDs spilling out in `InvoiceForm.tsx` by rendering explicit labels in the select triggers
- Dashboard home: Appointments now default to `This month`, and appointment-side money totals de-duplicate repeated visits from the same job so card totals stay accurate
- Jobs: booking flow now renders explicit labels for UUID-backed selects, includes provider wage percentage in the booking payment summary, and job detail can queue `Send to Client` / `Send to Cleaner` confirmation structure plus 24h/1h reminders
- Quotes: fixed Vercel type-check failure in `QuoteForm.tsx` by aligning `react-hook-form` with Zod's coerced number input/output types for pricing fields
- Reports: added Grow > Report before Marketing in `Sidebar.tsx`; new `/reports` page uses `lib/supabase/queries/reports.ts` for Supabase-backed overview metrics, revenue, cashflow, lead conversion, and job performance. Verified with `npm run lint` (existing `JobForm.tsx` warning only), `npm run build`, and `http://localhost:3000/reports` returning 200.
- Clients: client detail tabs now include Requests, Quotes, Jobs, Invoices, and Notes; Jobs show scheduled date/time, assigned team members, type/frequency, status, and value.
- Quotes: `/quotes` now shows Supabase-backed overview/report cards for status counts, 30-day conversion rate, sent quote count/value, and converted quote-job count/value; no hard-coded card totals.
- Quotes/Jobs: quote detail now uses a `Convert to Job` action that reuses an existing linked job instead of duplicating it; job detail shows the source quote link when `jobs.quote_id` is present.
- Jobs: job board now shows service address and assigned team members, supports inline status changes from `/jobs`, and job detail `Job Info` also shows the assigned team.
- Quotes: quote table now shows service address and created date, and status can be changed inline with a colored dropdown from `/quotes`.
- Quotes: `/quotes` filters are URL-synced so changing one keeps the others, and custom date filtering now supports a from/to range instead of a single date.

**Still open / to do next:**
- `lib/supabase/types.ts` needs regeneration after any new migration: run `npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id pnnczpsvvuwgzpkqfizv > lib/supabase/types.ts` (requires `supabase login` first)
- Parent folder `C:\Users\Admin\Music\Growndly\package-lock.json` causes Next.js workspace-root warning on build — delete it or set `turbopack.root` in `next.config.ts`

## UI Design System (locked — never regress)

**Sidebar:** `linear-gradient(175deg, #0d1c2e 0%, #091422 100%)` — dark navy. Active item: `bg-white/[0.09]` + 3px left accent `#29b6f6`. Hover: `bg-white/[0.055]`.

**Topbar:** `bg-white/80 backdrop-blur-xl` frosted glass.

**Cards:** `rounded-2xl border border-[#e4ecf3] bg-white shadow-[0_1px_4px_rgba(0,20,40,0.05)]`
Hover: `hover:-translate-y-[3px] hover:shadow-[0_8px_28px_rgba(0,20,40,0.10)]`

**Colors:**
| Role | Value |
|---|---|
| Brand blue | `#007bb8` / `oklch(0.545 0.137 232)` |
| Page bg | `oklch(0.984 0.004 232)` |
| Text primary | `#1a2d3d` |
| Text secondary | `#4a6070` |
| Text muted | `#9baab8` |
| Danger | `#d32f2f` |

**Workflow card accent colors:**
- Request: `from-[#ff9800] to-[#ffb74d]`
- Quote: `from-[#9c27b0] to-[#ce93d8]`
- Job: `from-[#007bb8] to-[#29b6f6]`
- Invoice: `from-[#1565c0] to-[#1e88e5]`

**Animations (`globals.css`):** `.animate-fade-up` (opacity+translateY, 0.48s), `.animate-fade-in` (0.35s). Stagger cards by ~60ms each.
